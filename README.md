1. INTRODUCTION
          A robot is a machine to execute different tasks repeatedly with high accuracy. Thereby many functions like collecting information and studies about the hazardous sites which is too risky to send human inside. Robots are used to reduce the human interference by nearly 50%. Robots are used in different types like fire fighting robot, metal detecting robot, etc. The first robotic arm to be used in an automobile industry was “UNIMATE” in GM motors USA in the 1950s. From then, there has been enormous improvement in the research and development in robotics. Now robots are an integral part of almost all industries. Robots have to do different tasks including welding, trimming, picking and placing.
